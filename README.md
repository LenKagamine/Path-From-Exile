Path-From-Exile
===============
A simple game I made for my Grade 10 ICS Summative

Controls:
- left/right = walk
- up = jump (up again to double jump)
- down = fall faster
- z = shoot
- x = stab/dash
- c = swing
- v = glide (only when falling)
- enter = select (in menu)

Main class is KM_Summative

Requires any version of JLayer (available here: http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html)

- Music from Touhou
- Background images from [Cave Story](http://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/cavestory/)
